                <h2> The Man who knew Infinity</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), 
                    Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries
                     of the properties of the partition function.

                    When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s
                     Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems,
                      many presented with only the briefest 
                     of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s book,
                      Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas. In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras
                       but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics.</p>
